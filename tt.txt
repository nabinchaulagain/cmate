 Courage is not only the basis of virtue; it is its expression. Faith, hope, charity and all-the rest don't 
become virtues until it takes courage to exercise them. There are roughly. Two types of courage. The first 
an emotional state which urges a man to risk injury or death, is physical courage. The second, more 
reasoning attitude which enables him to take coolly his career, happiness, his whole future or his judgment 
of what he thinks either right or worthwhile, Cs moral courage. 
 I have known many men, who had marked physical courage, but lacked moral courage. Some of them 
were in high places, but they failed to be great in themselves because they lacked moral courage. On the 
other hand, I have seen men who undoubtedly possessed moral courage but were very cautious about 
taking physical risks. But I have never met a man with moral courage who couldn't, when it was really 
necessary, face a situation boldly.
